# US-College-Data-Analysis

The US College data set is available in ISLR2 package in R  . 
This is an old dataset but is great to practice some data analysis . 

In this analysis , we want to find out 

1)If colleges with larger full time enrollments have lower grad rates ?

2)Is it diff for public/private institutions?
